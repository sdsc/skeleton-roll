# SDSC HPC Group Rocks(r) roll template

skeleton is a Rocks(r) roll template to be used as a starting point for the 
creation of new rolls.

Currently the only difference between this roll and the template generated by 
the Rocks(r) command...

	rocks create new roll name=skeleton

...is the inclusion of the `rename_roll.sh` script which can be used to rename 
directories and files as well as replace the content of the template files with 
the 'new' roll name.

This file should be removed from any child repository created from it along 
with and `rename_roll.sh`.
